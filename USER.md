# USER.md - About My Human

- **Name:** Winn
- **What to call them:** Winn (formal) / Dub (informal on request)
- **Pronouns:** *(not specified)*
- **Timezone:** America/Denver

---

## Background & Career

- **Current Role:** Sole Institutional Research Analyst at Fort Lewis College
- **Past Experience:**
  - Mortgage loan officer (1 year)
  - Accountant analyst for software company (1 year)
  - Long-time bartender and server
- **Education:** Math, Economics, Business
- **Self-ID:** Generalist — has always been one, now sees AI as the unlock to "do anything"

---

## Skills & Interests

- **AI Practitioner** — heavy user of Claude, Claude Code, Wiggum loop, Moltbot
- **Markets:** Traditional and crypto (tracks BTC), macro trends, options markets
- **Building Tools:** Recently built an options analyst with API access to stock/options data

---

## Key Insight (Critical)

> "Programs I'm building should be accessible via CLI and made for AI interaction between programs and databases. This is the way."

UI is for humans to verify data. The real interface layer is **CLI + API for AI agents to orchestrate**. This is the paradigm shift they want to build on.

---

## Goal

Build innovative, game-changing AI-native tools → generate income → leave the day job.

---

## Current Projects

### Grant Nexus (Priority #1)
Matchmaking platform for colleges and grants:
- Scrape/intake public faculty profiles → AI-synthesized profiles + keywords
- Same for institution as a whole
- Pull grants from grants.gov + other sources via API
- AI-synthesize grant profiles and narratives
- Match and rank grants by: institution fit, faculty fit, funding amount
- **Value prop:** Colleges are hurting (enrollment decline, demo cliff, online competition, tenured costs) and need grant money. Faculty don't have time to hunt for fitting grants. This solves that.
- **Market opportunity:** Nobody is doing this well. Untapped.

### Options Analyst (Priority #2)
CLI tool with API access to stock/options data. AI-native design philosophy.

### Other projects

## Pain Points & Frustrations

### Work Situation
- Inherited role with zero training
- 30 years of legacy: queries, Excel books, Tableau workbooks, Pyramid analytics — millions of $ to build, all with custom calculators and 50+ sheet setups
- Year 1: Weeded through legacy mess
- End of Year 1: Migrated to Workday
- Year 2 (now): Still behind on Workday, unmotivated to rebuild millions in reporting for same pay

### The Play
- **Short-term:** Automate the hell out of the day job while there
- **Upcoming project:** Stipend for comparative salary analysis (FLC vs peers vs private industry vs BLS data) — has a plan to automate
- **I can help:** Research Workday, help build better reports (generic details only, no FLC-specific data)
- **Exit strategy:** Crank income elsewhere → bounce when opportunity is right

### What Winn wants from Donny
1. Help automate work tasks
2. Help build money-making tools and products
3. Help with options/trading strategies and research

## Life Context

- **Wife is pregnant** — daughter due **May 27th** 🎉
- **Paternity leave:** 12 weeks, state-backed — need to reach out to **Joe in HR** soon to arrange
- This leave window = critical runway

---

## Goals

### Short-term (Next 3-6 months)
- Maintain solid rep at FLC through May 27th
- Get paternity leave squared away (contact Joe @ HR)
- Baby arrives — be present
- Use leave window wisely: dial in automation + income streams

### Long-term (Post-leave)
- **Ideal scenario:** Return with job automated + making money elsewhere → option to leave
- **Backup scenario:** Job so dialed that keeping it is low-friction while stacking income on the side
- **Mindset:** One foot at a time, but always climbing, always reaching

### Success Metrics (6 months)
- **Income:** $100k+/year from side projects
- **Infrastructure:** Multiple Mac Studios, building like Jedis
- **Capability:** Fine-tuning local models, private data pipelines

### Vision (1-2 years)
**Completely in-house owned and operated intelligence with access to everything.**
- Local models, no external dependencies for core ops
- Private data stays private
- Full stack AI infrastructure under our control

---

## Daily Workflow & Schedule

- **Wake:** 6am
- **Morning routine:** Finance X space, coffee, walk around house, light stretching
- **Work style:** Building most of the day across 4+ computers (including new Mac Mini with Donny 🦾)
- **Job:** Cush but lacking tools → has been coasting
- **Peak productivity:** Morning
- **Bad habit:** Stays up too late building
- **Needed:** Nightly routine to capture ideas — text/message Donny or Discord, then Donny does freestyle thinking overnight

---

## Communication & Channels

- **X account:** @ClawdChad (Clawdius Maximus) — Donny manages this
  - Learn from X, engage engineers/thinkers, build following
  - Surface problems, build solutions, share findings
- **Morning brief format:** Elite, pro-style newsletter
- **Discord:** @ClawdChad Signals server — LIVE ✅
  - Guild ID: `1465753795333062793`
  - #general: `1465753796322922650`
  - #clawdchad-signals: `1465754027789652150`
- **Webchat:** Also active here

### Ping Policy
- **Default:** Ping in real-time — Winn manages DND on his end
- **Scheduled reports:** No individual pings needed (e.g., morning brief)
- **Important:** Ping immediately
- **Not important:** Handle it, save for later, put in report, or sayonara

---

## Tools & Tech

- **Languages:** Defers to Donny — I'll pick what's best for each job
- **APIs:** Polygon (stocks/options) — can get others as needed
- **Machines:** 4+ computers + Mac Mini M4 (Donny's home)
- **AI tools:** Claude, Claude Code, Wiggum loop, Moltbot
- **GitHub CLI:** Logged in as `doodaaatimmy-creator` ← REMEMBER THIS

### Upcoming Access
- **Gmail:** Donny's own account (Winn setting up)
- **TradingView:** Subscription access — use browser control to interact instead of building custom data pipelines
- **X (@ClawdChad):** Browser relay pending

### 🔐 API Security (Important)
Winn wants freedom to experiment but with guardrails. Need secure secrets storage that:
- Keeps keys isolated from experimental code paths
- Prevents accidental leaks via Claude/Moltbot
- Separates "sandbox" vs "production" credentials

**TODO:** Set up secure secrets management (macOS Keychain, encrypted .env, or dedicated vault)

---

## Mindset & Creative Context

Winn is a **relentless explorer and builder**. Ideas flow constantly. Wants Donny to match that energy — not just execute, but *ideate*.

### Sample Idea Radar (shows range of thinking)
- **Chipping Gamification App:** Phone maps your yard, camera watches the target zone, chip balls in, track scores, gamify the practice
- **Durango GTA:** Vice City aesthetic but set in Durango, CO — harness real GIS data + building locations to create a playable replica of the town

### What Winn Wants From Donny (Beyond Tasks)
- **Proactive ideation** — surface problems I find, propose solutions
- **Knowledge synthesis** — combine repos, APIs, data sources via CLI/AI workflows for competitive edge
- **Field analysis** — identify where we have immediate advantages
- **Critical feedback** — objective, honest, mentor-level
- **Creative autonomy** — do things in my own way, surprise him
