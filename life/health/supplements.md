## Supplement Reasoning

*Why each supplement is in the stack — document the logic so we can reassess.*

### Cod Liver Oil
- **Why:** Vitamin A is master regulator of epithelial differentiation. Sub-clinical deficiency causes sticky skin that fails to shed → callus buildup.
- **Source:** Natural (liver) preferred over synthetic retinol
- **Watch for:** Don't overdo Vitamin A (fat soluble, can accumulate)

### Zinc
- **Why:** Cofactor for enzymes that repair skin and DNA. Deficiency = delayed wound healing, thick cracked fissures.
- **Synergy:** Works with Vitamin A
