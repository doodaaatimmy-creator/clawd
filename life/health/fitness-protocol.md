## 🔗 CONNECTION TO FOOT PROTOCOL

This isn't separate — it's synergistic:
- **Calf work** → lengthens posterior chain, reduces toe pressure
- **Core strength** → better posture, less compensation patterns
- **Hip mobility** → affects entire kinetic chain to feet
- **Balance work** → activates foot stabilizers

Strong body = faster foot recovery.
