## ⚠️ EXPECTATIONS

**This is a 3-6 month minimum commitment.**

- Week 1-4: Building habits, may not notice much change
- Month 2-3: Should start noticing reduced stiffness, better flexibility
- Month 4-6: Potential tissue changes, reduced pain

**What this CAN do:** Reduce pain, improve mobility, soften scar tissue, slow progression
**What this CANNOT do:** Reverse bone deformity — that requires surgery
