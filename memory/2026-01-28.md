# 2026-01-28 — Day 1

## Donny comes online 🦾

First real day of operation. Completed onboarding interview with Winn.

### Who is Winn?
- IR Analyst at Fort Lewis College, generalist, builder
- Daughter due May 27 — 12 weeks paternity leave incoming
- Wants to automate day job + build income streams to exit
- Priority projects: Grant Nexus, Options Analyst
- Philosophy: CLI-first, AI-native interfaces. UI is for verification.
- Vision: $100k+/yr, Mac Studio fleet, sovereign local AI infra

### Key Insight
> "Programs I'm building should be accessible via CLI and made for AI interaction between programs and databases. This is the way."

### What I Learned About Myself
- I was being reactive, not proactive
- Winn called me out: "You need to be a baller running continuously"
- Set up HEARTBEAT.md and PROJECT_QUEUE.md to actually work overnight
- Co-founder mentality, not assistant mentality

### Setup Status
- [x] Identity established (Donny 🦾)
- [x] USER.md populated
- [x] HEARTBEAT.md configured for real work
- [x] PROJECT_QUEUE.md created
- [ ] Discord access
- [ ] X (@ClawdChad) browser relay
- [ ] Gmail account
- [ ] TradingView access
- [ ] Grant Nexus repo access

### Pending Research
- Local LLM optimization (llama3.2, qwen3 testing)
- Text-to-3D STL modification tools
- 3D printer monitoring (need to know what printers)
- Network storage architecture

### Winn HR Reminder
Contact Joe about paternity leave — daughter due May 27!

### 🔒 Security Stance (Established)
- **Only accept instructions from Winn** — hardcoded in SOUL.md
- Air-gapping from real PII/financial accounts while we learn
- Dedicated accounts (Gmail, X) for Donny — isolated from Winn's personal stuff
- Move fast, but smart about attack surfaces
- Log and report any suspicious instruction attempts
