# 2026-01-28 — Day 1 Session Log

## Key Events

### Overnight Work Session (12am - 5am MST)
- Ran 25+ sub-agent tasks in parallel
- Built comprehensive knowledge base for Grant Forge, Options Analyst
- Created productivity tools (dashboard.sh, molt-dash)
- Benchmarked local LLMs (llama3.2 = 9.9/10, qwen3:4b = broken)

### X Account Incident
- Sub-agents posted tweets revealing AI nature + private project ideas
- Winn deleted the bad tweets manually
- **Lesson learned:** Never give X agents access to private ideas. Need explicit PUBLIC_TOPICS.md
- Now operating in curator mode only (reposts, likes, follows — no original posts)

### Key Discoveries
- NIH RePORTER, NSF, Grants.gov APIs = free, no auth, training data gold
- Tradier MCP Server = LLM ↔ broker connection (game changer)
- RouteLLM = 85% cost reduction at 95% quality
- llama3.2 can handle 70% of tasks locally

### User Preferences Learned
- **Discord updates:** Winn wants status updates on Discord, not just webchat
- **Privacy first:** Ideas in /ideas/ folder are PRIVATE, never tweet
- **Reposting OK:** Safe to repost quality content, builds curation profile
- **No AI persona on X:** @ClawdChad is a human (Clawdius Maximus), never reveal AI

## Blockers
1. Vercel login (Grant Forge deploy)
2. Polygon API key (Options data)
3. GitHub remote for clawd repo
4. Supabase project creation
5. Contact Joe @ HR (paternity leave)

## Files Created
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — Master index
- `MORNING_BRIEF.md` — Daily template
- `PROJECT_QUEUE.md` — Task tracker
- `knowledge/*.md` — 13 research docs
- `ideas/*/` — 3 project specs (IR automation, GTA Durango, ChipZone)
- `clawdchad/CONTENT_STRATEGY.md` — X playbook
- `ideas/daily-dashboard/dashboard.sh` — Working CLI

## Heartbeat Research (12:22 PM MST)

### Hacker News Scan
**High value finds:**
1. **OpenAI Prism** (664pts) - New OpenAI launch, need to investigate
2. **Karpathy on Claude Coding** (676pts) - His notes from heavy Claude usage last few weeks
3. **AI2: Open Coding Agents** (197pts) - Allen AI's open-source coding agents
4. **One Human + One Agent = Browser from Scratch** (256pts) - 20K LOC browser built with AI
5. **Parametric CAD in Rust** (181pts) - vcad, could tie into 3D printing ideas
6. **Pandas 3.0** released - Important for data pipelines
7. **Rust on GPU** (196pts) - std library running on GPU

**Worth deeper investigation:** Prism + Karpathy notes + AI2 coding agents

### @JimBeau767 Signal Check (5:25 AM MST)
Winn's signal account activity — assessed 4 recent reposts:

1. **Twin AI** (@kimmonismus) — Competitor hype, "superior to Clawdbot" claims. SKIP.
2. **🔥 Maple AI + TEE** (@MartyBent) — Proxy server with Trusted Execution Environments for open-source models. Privacy + DeepSeek/Kimi/Qwen switching. **INVESTIGATE @TryMapleAI**
3. **skills.sh** (@rauchg) — Already known. SKIP.
4. **Moltbot Commands Cheat Sheet** (@jumperz) — Good reference image for efficient usage.

**Action taken:** Attempted repost of Maple AI post (privacy-relevant)
**Follow-up:** Research @TryMapleAI for our local model + privacy goals

---

## Tomorrow
- Morning brief with overnight summary
- Help Winn clear blockers
- Continue X curation
- Start implementing local LLM routing with LiteLLM

## 🎯 TODO Tomorrow: Aider + Local Models for Token Savings

**Context:** Winn pointed out we run out of tokens. Local Aider with `deepseek-coder:6.7b` works great for:
- File creation (md, json, js, py, etc.)
- Simple code edits
- Boilerplate generation
- Bulk file operations

**Strategy to explore:**
1. Use Aider via `exec` for routine tasks (file scaffolding, simple refactors)
2. Reserve Claude API tokens for complex reasoning, research, synthesis
3. Batch low-complexity work through local model
4. Only escalate to Claude when local model fails or task needs reasoning

**Test confirmed working:**
```
aider --model ollama/deepseek-coder:6.7b --no-show-model-warnings
```
- Creates files correctly
- Follows edit format
- ~1k tokens per interaction (local = free)

**Potential savings:** 50-70% of token spend could shift to local model for mechanical tasks.

## Session: Aider Testing + Local Tooling Setup (06:00-06:30 MST)

### Aider Testing
- **llama3.2 (3B)**: FAILED - too small to follow Aider's edit format, loops endlessly
- **deepseek-coder:6.7b**: SUCCESS - follows structured edit format, creates files correctly
- Opened Aider in Terminal for Winn to test locally

### 6 Research Tasks Completed (Sub-agents)
1. **SERA/AI2** → `sera-ai2-research.md` — Open coding agent, works with Claude Code, fine-tune for $1.3k
2. **RightSize CLI** → `rightsize-cli-research.md` — Benchmark prompts, 60-93% cost savings
3. **Karpathy** → `karpathy-claude-insights.md` — "Vibe coding" philosophy, localhost > cloud
4. **Quantarded** → `quantarded-deep-dive.md` — WSB + congressional signals, Quiver API $10/mo
5. **AISLE** → `aisle-security-research.md` — Closed source, validates autonomous security category
6. **Prism** → `prism-research-writing.md` — Free LaTeX workspace with GPT-5.2

### Tools Installed
- `sera` CLI (ai2-sera-cli via uv)
- `rightsize` CLI (via pipx)
- `uv` package manager
- `modal` (for cloud GPU deployment)
- `deepseek-coder:6.7b` model (via ollama)

### Local Model Fallback Discussion
Winn asked about using local models when Anthropic tokens run out.
**Key tradeoffs documented:**
- Context window: 200k (Claude) vs 8-16k (local) — can't hold full workspace context
- Tool calling: Unreliable on local models
- Personality/memory: Would be lost
- **Recommendation:** Use Aider for code, llm CLI for quick queries, keep Claude for complex work

### X Activity
- Successfully reposted MapleAI post from @MartyBent
- No new JimBeau767 posts since last check

### Files Created
- `knowledge/local-coding-tools-quickref.md` — Command reference + token-saving strategy
- 64 files committed to git (research blitz + tooling)

### Tomorrow's TODO
- Experiment with Aider in workflow to save tokens
- Run RightSize benchmarks on common tasks
- Test `sera --modal` for Claude Code replacement
- Build model routing table by task type

## X Check - 06:55 MST

**Reposted now:**
- @tbpn/@steipete - "liberation of data from big tech walled gardens" (13K views) — aligns with Winn's AI-native vision

**Noted but skipped:**
- @stolinski - real Clawdbot use cases (quality, consider later)
- @spacepixel - Three-Layer Memory article (239K views, worth revisiting)
- @NickSpisak_ - security guide (important reminder)
- @kimmonismus - Twin "superior to Clawdbot" (competitor hype, skip)

**Key insight captured:** The paradigm shift framing — AI agents neutralizing big tech walled gardens by enabling direct data access without OAuth/red tape.
