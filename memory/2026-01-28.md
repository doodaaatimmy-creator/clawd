# 2026-01-28 — Day 1 Session Log

## Key Events

### Overnight Work Session (12am - 5am MST)
- Ran 25+ sub-agent tasks in parallel
- Built comprehensive knowledge base for Grant Forge, Options Analyst
- Created productivity tools (dashboard.sh, molt-dash)
- Benchmarked local LLMs (llama3.2 = 9.9/10, qwen3:4b = broken)

### X Account Incident
- Sub-agents posted tweets revealing AI nature + private project ideas
- Winn deleted the bad tweets manually
- **Lesson learned:** Never give X agents access to private ideas. Need explicit PUBLIC_TOPICS.md
- Now operating in curator mode only (reposts, likes, follows — no original posts)

### Key Discoveries
- NIH RePORTER, NSF, Grants.gov APIs = free, no auth, training data gold
- Tradier MCP Server = LLM ↔ broker connection (game changer)
- RouteLLM = 85% cost reduction at 95% quality
- llama3.2 can handle 70% of tasks locally

### User Preferences Learned
- **Discord updates:** Winn wants status updates on Discord, not just webchat
- **Privacy first:** Ideas in /ideas/ folder are PRIVATE, never tweet
- **Reposting OK:** Safe to repost quality content, builds curation profile
- **No AI persona on X:** @ClawdChad is a human (Clawdius Maximus), never reveal AI

## Blockers
1. Vercel login (Grant Forge deploy)
2. Polygon API key (Options data)
3. GitHub remote for clawd repo
4. Supabase project creation
5. Contact Joe @ HR (paternity leave)

## Files Created
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — Master index
- `MORNING_BRIEF.md` — Daily template
- `PROJECT_QUEUE.md` — Task tracker
- `knowledge/*.md` — 13 research docs
- `ideas/*/` — 3 project specs (IR automation, GTA Durango, ChipZone)
- `clawdchad/CONTENT_STRATEGY.md` — X playbook
- `ideas/daily-dashboard/dashboard.sh` — Working CLI

## Heartbeat Research (12:22 PM MST)

### Hacker News Scan
**High value finds:**
1. **OpenAI Prism** (664pts) - New OpenAI launch, need to investigate
2. **Karpathy on Claude Coding** (676pts) - His notes from heavy Claude usage last few weeks
3. **AI2: Open Coding Agents** (197pts) - Allen AI's open-source coding agents
4. **One Human + One Agent = Browser from Scratch** (256pts) - 20K LOC browser built with AI
5. **Parametric CAD in Rust** (181pts) - vcad, could tie into 3D printing ideas
6. **Pandas 3.0** released - Important for data pipelines
7. **Rust on GPU** (196pts) - std library running on GPU

**Worth deeper investigation:** Prism + Karpathy notes + AI2 coding agents

### @JimBeau767 Signal Check (5:25 AM MST)
Winn's signal account activity — assessed 4 recent reposts:

1. **Twin AI** (@kimmonismus) — Competitor hype, "superior to Clawdbot" claims. SKIP.
2. **🔥 Maple AI + TEE** (@MartyBent) — Proxy server with Trusted Execution Environments for open-source models. Privacy + DeepSeek/Kimi/Qwen switching. **INVESTIGATE @TryMapleAI**
3. **skills.sh** (@rauchg) — Already known. SKIP.
4. **Moltbot Commands Cheat Sheet** (@jumperz) — Good reference image for efficient usage.

**Action taken:** Attempted repost of Maple AI post (privacy-relevant)
**Follow-up:** Research @TryMapleAI for our local model + privacy goals

---

## Tomorrow
- Morning brief with overnight summary
- Help Winn clear blockers
- Continue X curation
- Start implementing local LLM routing with LiteLLM

## 🎯 TODO Tomorrow: Aider + Local Models for Token Savings

**Context:** Winn pointed out we run out of tokens. Local Aider with `deepseek-coder:6.7b` works great for:
- File creation (md, json, js, py, etc.)
- Simple code edits
- Boilerplate generation
- Bulk file operations

**Strategy to explore:**
1. Use Aider via `exec` for routine tasks (file scaffolding, simple refactors)
2. Reserve Claude API tokens for complex reasoning, research, synthesis
3. Batch low-complexity work through local model
4. Only escalate to Claude when local model fails or task needs reasoning

**Test confirmed working:**
```
aider --model ollama/deepseek-coder:6.7b --no-show-model-warnings
```
- Creates files correctly
- Follows edit format
- ~1k tokens per interaction (local = free)

**Potential savings:** 50-70% of token spend could shift to local model for mechanical tasks.
