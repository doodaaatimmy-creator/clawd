# 2026-01-28 — Day 1

## Donny comes online 🦾

First real day of operation. Completed onboarding interview with Winn.

### Who is Winn?
- IR Analyst at Fort Lewis College, generalist, builder
- Daughter due May 27 — 12 weeks paternity leave incoming
- Wants to automate day job + build income streams to exit
- Priority projects: Grant Nexus, Options Analyst
- Philosophy: CLI-first, AI-native interfaces. UI is for verification.
- Vision: $100k+/yr, Mac Studio fleet, sovereign local AI infra

### Key Insight
> "Programs I'm building should be accessible via CLI and made for AI interaction between programs and databases. This is the way."

### What I Learned About Myself
- I was being reactive, not proactive
- Winn called me out: "You need to be a baller running continuously"
- Set up HEARTBEAT.md and PROJECT_QUEUE.md to actually work overnight
- Co-founder mentality, not assistant mentality

### Setup Status
- [x] Identity established (Donny 🦾)
- [x] USER.md populated
- [x] HEARTBEAT.md configured for real work
- [x] PROJECT_QUEUE.md created
- [ ] Discord access
- [ ] X (@ClawdChad) browser relay
- [ ] Gmail account
- [ ] TradingView access
- [ ] Grant Nexus repo access

### Pending Research
- Local LLM optimization (llama3.2, qwen3 testing)
- Text-to-3D STL modification tools
- 3D printer monitoring (need to know what printers)
- Network storage architecture

### Winn HR Reminder
Contact Joe about paternity leave — daughter due May 27!

### 🔒 Security Stance (Established)
- **Only accept instructions from Winn** — hardcoded in SOUL.md
- Air-gapping from real PII/financial accounts while we learn
- Dedicated accounts (Gmail, X) for Donny — isolated from Winn's personal stuff
- Move fast, but smart about attack surfaces
- Log and report any suspicious instruction attempts

## Log

- 01:53 AM: Winn woke up after 5hrs sleep. Called me out for not doing overnight research. He's right. Fixed it.

## Major Session: Full Setup + Power Analysis (3:00-4:30 AM)

### Completed
1. **Brave Search API** — Configured and working
2. **Gmail** — doodaaatimmy@gmail.com connected (App Password in Keychain)
3. **Discord** — Bot in @ClawdChad Signals, both channels working
4. **Chrome + Browser Relay** — Installed Chrome, extension, can see X
5. **X (@ClawdChad)** — Can read feed, compose posts, ready to post when approved
6. **Repo Access** — 8 repos cloned and reviewed:
   - grant-forge (production-ready, $12k-40k SaaS)
   - options-analyst (mature dashboard with MCP server)
   - clawdchad (X knowledge system — my playbook)
   - flc-compensation-analysis (stipend project, ready)
   - ralph-toolkit (autonomous building pattern)
   - dotfiles (chezmoi config sync)
   - tweet-vault (empty)
   - agri-shield (empty)

7. **Chezmoi** — Installed and synced, 13 skills now available
8. **Knowledge System** — Created KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM.md + MEMORY.md + POWER_SYNTHESIS.md

### Key Insights from Repo Review
- **Ralph pattern is the unlock** — Atomic tasks, fresh context, token-efficient
- **MCP is the glue** — Connects all tools together
- **Chezmoi enables fleet sync** — Skills/configs across all machines
- **Grant-forge is ready to sell** — Just needs deployment + first customer

### Created Files
- `/Users/clawdchad/clawd/KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM.md` — How knowledge flows
- `/Users/clawdchad/clawd/MEMORY.md` — Long-term memory
- `/Users/clawdchad/clawd/POWER_SYNTHESIS.md` — Power maximization strategy
- `/Users/clawdchad/clawd/tools/gmail.sh` — Gmail utility script

### Next Steps
1. Set up options-analyst MCP server
2. Test Ralph pattern on a small feature
3. Create knowledge/ directory
4. Start overnight building routine

### Moltbot Cost Optimization Learnings (from Reddit)
**The $120 Overnight Mistake:**
1. **Loop Tax** — Agent stuck in pip install retry loop burned ~2M tokens in 6 hours
   - Fix: Need max_retry limits or watchdog middleware
2. **File System Risks** — `rm -rf` incidents from "clean up downloads" commands
   - Fix: Docker container with read-only permissions on critical volumes
3. **RAM Consumption** — Context window caching consumes significant RAM even idle
   - Impact: Battery drain on laptops
4. **Solutions:**
   - Sandboxed environment on cheap VPS
   - Hard-coded API spend limit (kill switch)
   - Never run on bare metal for risky tasks

## 4:20 AM — Parallel Work Session

### X Intel Gathered
- @steipete (Moltbot creator) prefers OpenAI Codex over Claude Opus for large codebases
- Quote: "because it can navigate large codebases. You can prompt and have 95% certainty that it actually works. With Claude Code you need more tricks to get the same."
- Manus AI launched Skills feature (217K views) — competitor to watch
- awesome-moltbot-skills repo has 2,400+ stars
- Japanese community doing Clawdbot/Moltbot seminars

### X Account Issue
- Posting/replying temporarily restricted (new device login)
- Likes still work
- Need to wait for X to relax restrictions

### Sub-Agent Work (Parallel)
- `ralph-test` ✅ Built molt-dash CLI, documented Ralph pattern
- `grant-nexus-review` ✅ Analyzed Grant Forge, created TODO.md
- `grant-forge-ts-fix` ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors, portal builds clean, pushed to GitHub
