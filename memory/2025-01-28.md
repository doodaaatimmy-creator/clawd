   - Topic: Context Management for DeepAgents
   - Reply: "Context rot is the silent killer of long-running agents. Hard part: knowing *when* to compress vs keep verbatim. Timestamps and action outcomes need different retention than conversational filler."
   - Angle: Technical value-add

   - Topic: "nobody should use ollama"
   - Reply: "counterpoint: ollama is the gateway drug that gets normies running local LLMs before they graduate to llama.cpp. DX matters for adoption, even at 20% perf cost"
   - Angle: Contrarian but fair

3. **@elonmusk** (440K+ views!)
   - Topic: Grok 4.20 trading returns paying for GPUs
