#### 📝 Entry Rationale (documented at open)

**Why AMD over other candidates:**
1. **IV Rank: 11.7%** — Options historically cheap (vs NVDA at 73%)
2. **Negative gamma regime** — Dealers short gamma, moves get amplified
3. **Imminent catalyst** — Earnings Feb 3 (before momentum fades)
4. **Analyst conviction** — UBS $330, Piper Sandler $300 (raised ahead of earnings)

**The Thesis:**
AMD is the second-mover advantage play in AI compute. While everyone obsesses over NVDA (expensive options), AMD is quietly:
- Landing OpenAI chip deals — validation as legitimate #2
- Projecting $14-15B AI GPU revenue in 2026 — 2x YoY growth
- Benefiting from Meta's $115-135B capex — not all going to Nvidia
- Helios chip ramp creating new growth vector

**Market Context at Entry:**
- Software sector selloff (IGV -5%, bear market territory)
- Microsoft -10% on cloud growth slowdown
- AI disruption fears creating indiscriminate selling
- Fed held rates, no hawkish surprise
- Tariffs in 30-day pause (negotiation theater)
- **Contrarian entry**: Fear in tech = opportunity in quality names

**Why $350 Strike (vs recommended $320):**
- Winn chose higher risk/higher reward
- If AMD hits UBS target ($330), $350c still has value from IV expansion + time
- If AMD overshoots to $380+, this is a 10-bagger
- Defined risk: max loss = $355 premium

**Catalyst Stack:**
1. **Feb 3** — Q4 earnings (AI GPU revenue update)
2. **Feb-Mar** — Helios chip ramp, MI300 successor details
3. **Ongoing** — Meta/Microsoft/OpenAI spending = demand tailwind
4. **March 4** — Tariff deadline (resolution = tech pump)

**Key Levels:**
- $280 — Analyst consensus target
- $300 — Piper Sandler target
- $330 — UBS target
- $353.55 — Break-even at expiry

**Risk Factors Identified:**
- Earnings miss or weak guidance
- Tariffs actually implemented (March 4)
- Broader tech selloff continues
- NVDA announces something that steals narrative

---

**Notes:**
- Riskier strike than recommended $320, but higher asymmetry if it hits
- This is a speculation play — sized appropriately (small % of portfolio)
