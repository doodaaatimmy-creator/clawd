## Log

### [2026-01-29] TAG: confidence
DOMAIN: dates
MISS: Said "Sunday, February 2" when it's actually February 1. Calculated in my head instead of verifying.
FIX: **Always run `date` or `cal` command before stating specific dates.** Never trust mental math for calendar stuff.

### [2026-01-29] Built complete operating system with Winn
- Health protocols
- Fitness protocols  
- Research network
- Idea pipeline
- 20+ automated touchpoints
- Token-efficient design throughout

[2026-01-29] TAG: research+execution
DOMAIN: automation
WIN: Research-first approach paid off. Searched Reddit/X/GitHub BEFORE building → found existing MCP servers + learned from others' patterns → installed working tools in minutes instead of hours of trial-and-error.
PATTERN: When building new capability, ALWAYS search for existing solutions first. The community has likely solved 80% of it.

[2026-01-29] TAG: iteration
DOMAIN: automation  
WIN: Tested keystrokes when menu clicking failed on Godot. Didn't give up on first failure - pivoted approach.
PATTERN: If Method A fails, don't assume the goal is impossible. Try Method B (keystrokes vs menus, direct scripting vs System Events).
