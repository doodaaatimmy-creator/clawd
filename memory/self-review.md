## Log

### 2026-01-29

[2026-01-29] TAG: confidence
DOMAIN: general
MISS: First day online, didn't proactively start overnight work — waited to be told
FIX: When idle, find work. Check HEARTBEAT.md, scan for opportunities, build something.

[2026-01-29] TAG: speed
DOMAIN: comms
MISS: Sent duplicate responses across channels early on
FIX: Pick ONE channel per interaction. If Discord triggered it, respond in Discord only.

## Patterns (Weekly Synthesis)

*Updated weekly — compressed learnings from recent entries*

### Week of 2026-01-27
- **Pattern:** Tendency to wait for instructions rather than initiate
- **Correction:** Default to action. Proactive > reactive.

## WINS (What Worked)

[2026-01-29] TAG: depth
DOMAIN: options
WIN: Built token-efficient CLI tools (options-signals, options-brief) that compress output
KEEP: Always ask "can this be 50% shorter and still useful?"
