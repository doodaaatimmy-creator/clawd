## 📝 Key Learnings

### Godot VR Development
- ALWAYS set `get_viewport().use_xr = true` even if OpenXR is initialized
- Quest export preset is "Meta Quest" not "Android"
- Launch via `adb shell am start -n <package>/com.godot.game.GodotAppLauncher`
- See `projects/quest-boxing/LEARNINGS.md` for full details

### Local-First Apps
- Can replace Supabase with JSON files for personal apps
- CLIs are often more useful than full web UIs
- Simple file-based databases are powerful for single-user apps
