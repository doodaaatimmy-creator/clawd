## X Research Cycle #2 (8:00 AM) ✅ COMPLETE

### Key Findings

**1. Competition Intel**
- **Twin** raised $10M, 100K agents deployed, cloud-based
- Positioned as "Moltbot killer" but some prefer Moltbot for privacy → **privacy is competitive moat**
- **Moltbot dev prefers OpenAI Codex over Claude** - mentioned on X as news item

**2. Solo Builder Economics**
- **Pieter Levels** making $3M/yr solo with AI automation
- Proves solo builders can generate massive revenue with AI-native products

**3. URGENT: Window Closing**
- **12-18 month window** before foundation models eat vertical SaaS
- Either ship fast or build deep data moats
- Grant Nexus advantage: **proprietary institutional data** = moat

**4. Enterprise Reality Check**
- **MIT finding: 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail production**
- Means: don't be enterprise yet, be nimble

**5. MLX + Apple Silicon Intel**
- **LM Studio + GLM-4.7-Flash** (30B MoE, 128k context) now in MLX - hot 🔥
- Hardware floor: 32GB Apple Silicon for serious local models
- Use **MLX not GGUF** on Apple Silicon
- M4 Mini 16GB options: Llama 3.2 (1-3B), Gemma 2 (9B), Mistral 7B
- High RAM targets: DeepSeek R1, GLM-4.7flash, lfm2.5

**6. University AI Validation**
- UC San Diego has **TritonGPT** for internal AI (job descriptions, grant accounting)
- Validates universities ARE building internal AI tools → Grant Nexus market exists

### Actionable Insights

1. **Ship Grant Nexus NOW** - 12-18mo window before foundation models commoditize matching
2. **Privacy as differentiator** - "some prefer Moltbot for privacy" = sell Grant Nexus as on-prem/privacy-first option to universities
3. **Build data moat** - Proprietary faculty/grant profiles that foundation models don't have
4. **Consider LM Studio + GLM-4.7-Flash** for local inference on future high-RAM machines

## 3D Printing + AI Research (9:50 AM) ✅ COMPLETE

### Text/Image → STL Tools
- **PrintPal.io** - 100K users, text/image → CAD for printing, STL/OBJ/GLB
- **Meshy.ai** - #1 AI 3D generator, 1-minute generation, multiple export formats
- **Sloyd.ai** - Unlimited generations, rigging + animation included
- **AdamCAD** (@adamcad_hq) - Text-to-CAD with precise dimensions, mobile friendly

### Print Monitoring
- **Obico** (Spaghetti Detective) - OctoPrint plugin, AI failure detection, self-hostable
- **PrintGuard** - Edge AI + camera for real-time failure detection

### Clawdbot Integration Ideas
Agent pipeline: Generate STL → Validate → Send to OctoPrint → Monitor via Obico → Alert on completion/failure

### Round 2 - Deeper Finds

**Local/Open Source:**
- **Hunyuan3D-2** - Open source image→3D, runs locally via Pinokio, works on RTX 3070
- **Pinokio** (pinokio.computer) - One-click local AI installer

**Printer Built-in AI:**
- Bambu Lab X1: Micro LiDAR, first layer inspection, auto nozzle adjust, AI monitoring

**STL Repair:**
- MeshInspector, Meshmixer, Formlabs auto-repair

### Round 3 - Freestyle Finds

**The ComfyUI 3D Pipeline (viral workflow, 50K views):**
1. Tripo → initial highpoly from 2 reference images
2. Hunyuan 3D Studio → lowpoly + auto UV unwrap
3. Trellis2 in ComfyUI → texturing + upscaling

**Key Repos:**
- `kijai/ComfyUI-Hunyuan3DWrapper` - run Hunyuan3D-2 in ComfyUI locally
- Hunyuan3D-2.1 now available - better textures, runs on medium GPUs

**Failure Analysis:**
- QV3D / QuinlyVision by @3dque - video → photogrammetry → 3D render of failed print
- AI identifies: under-extrusion, layer shift, spaghetti, overhangs

**Cloud Option:**
- RunComfy (runcomfy.com) - cloud ComfyUI with pre-built 3D workflows

**All-Local ComfyUI Stack:**
- Image gen + Video gen + Audio gen + 3D model gen
- People using this for 3D printing minis workflows

### Convergence Analysis (10:05 AM)

**Winn's Interest Intersections - Next-Level Plays:**

1. **Physical Agent** - MCP servers for hardware (OctoPrint, smart home, displays). Nobody building this yet.

2. **Options → Physical** - E-ink dashboards, LED strips for market regime, haptic alerts. Ambient market awareness.

3. **AI Print-on-Demand** - Text → AI generates → Print → Ship. Etsy-killer for custom 3D goods.

4. **Durango GTA** - Real GIS + AI textures + 3D printing = physical city collectibles.

5. **Grant Nexus + Maker Labs** - STEM/equipment grants for university maker spaces. Vertical expansion.

6. **The Everything Agent** - Multi-modal Clawdbot: text, voice, code, finance, physical, memory. Sovereign AI.

**Recommended first step:** Build OctoPrint MCP server. Smallest step that proves the biggest vision.

## Afternoon Session (7:00 AM MT)

### Infrastructure Wins
- **Clawd browser autonomous** — logged into @ClawdChad, no more manual tab attachment
- **Polygon API in keychain** — both `polygon` and `alpha-flow-intel` service names
- **Options watchlist populated** — SPY, QQQ, NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT

### Options Analyst Fixed
- Sub-agent fixed DuckDB schema (sequences for auto-increment)
- **PR #1 created** — https://github.com/WinnCook/options-analyst/pull/1
- Verified: 15,432 options contracts, 100 news articles ingested

### Local Token-Saving Tools Created
- `x-scout` — X feed analysis via local Ollama
- `article-scout` — article summarization
- `research-scout` — last30days + local synthesis wrapper
- All use qwen2.5-coder:14b by default

### Skills Added
- Cloned `mvanhorn/last30days-skill` to `/clawd/skills/`

### Grant Nexus Assessment Delivered
- Needs: Supabase, OpenAI (embeddings), Anthropic (matching)
- Recommendation: Ship with 3-week time-box, use FLC as pilot
- Key insight: 12-18mo window before foundation models commoditize vertical SaaS

### News Intel
- Microsoft telling engineers to use Claude Code despite OpenAI partnership
- Anthropic valuation hitting $350B
- Cursor AI reliability issues (90% agent mode failures)
- People moving to terminal tools (opencode, Claude Code)

### Accounts to Follow
- @heygurisingh — "Run Claude Code locally free"
- @Shashikant86 — SuperQode, local model integration
- @mvanhorn — last30days skill creator

### Memory Lesson
- **Forgot about x-scout and LOCAL_AI_TOOLS.md** — tools I built but didn't use
- Need to review my own docs before starting token-heavy tasks
