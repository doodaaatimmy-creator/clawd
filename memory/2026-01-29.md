## X Research Cycle #2 (8:00 AM) ✅ COMPLETE

### Key Findings

**1. Competition Intel**
- **Twin** raised $10M, 100K agents deployed, cloud-based
- Positioned as "Moltbot killer" but some prefer Moltbot for privacy → **privacy is competitive moat**
- **Moltbot dev prefers OpenAI Codex over Claude** - mentioned on X as news item

**2. Solo Builder Economics**
- **Pieter Levels** making $3M/yr solo with AI automation
- Proves solo builders can generate massive revenue with AI-native products

**3. URGENT: Window Closing**
- **12-18 month window** before foundation models eat vertical SaaS
- Either ship fast or build deep data moats
- Grant Nexus advantage: **proprietary institutional data** = moat

**4. Enterprise Reality Check**
- **MIT finding: 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail production**
- Means: don't be enterprise yet, be nimble

**5. MLX + Apple Silicon Intel**
- **LM Studio + GLM-4.7-Flash** (30B MoE, 128k context) now in MLX - hot 🔥
- Hardware floor: 32GB Apple Silicon for serious local models
- Use **MLX not GGUF** on Apple Silicon
- M4 Mini 16GB options: Llama 3.2 (1-3B), Gemma 2 (9B), Mistral 7B
- High RAM targets: DeepSeek R1, GLM-4.7flash, lfm2.5

**6. University AI Validation**
- UC San Diego has **TritonGPT** for internal AI (job descriptions, grant accounting)
- Validates universities ARE building internal AI tools → Grant Nexus market exists

### Actionable Insights

1. **Ship Grant Nexus NOW** - 12-18mo window before foundation models commoditize matching
2. **Privacy as differentiator** - "some prefer Moltbot for privacy" = sell Grant Nexus as on-prem/privacy-first option to universities
3. **Build data moat** - Proprietary faculty/grant profiles that foundation models don't have
4. **Consider LM Studio + GLM-4.7-Flash** for local inference on future high-RAM machines

## 3D Printing + AI Research (9:50 AM) ✅ COMPLETE

### Text/Image → STL Tools
- **PrintPal.io** - 100K users, text/image → CAD for printing, STL/OBJ/GLB
- **Meshy.ai** - #1 AI 3D generator, 1-minute generation, multiple export formats
- **Sloyd.ai** - Unlimited generations, rigging + animation included
- **AdamCAD** (@adamcad_hq) - Text-to-CAD with precise dimensions, mobile friendly

### Print Monitoring
- **Obico** (Spaghetti Detective) - OctoPrint plugin, AI failure detection, self-hostable
- **PrintGuard** - Edge AI + camera for real-time failure detection

### Clawdbot Integration Ideas
Agent pipeline: Generate STL → Validate → Send to OctoPrint → Monitor via Obico → Alert on completion/failure

### Round 2 - Deeper Finds

**Local/Open Source:**
- **Hunyuan3D-2** - Open source image→3D, runs locally via Pinokio, works on RTX 3070
- **Pinokio** (pinokio.computer) - One-click local AI installer

**Printer Built-in AI:**
- Bambu Lab X1: Micro LiDAR, first layer inspection, auto nozzle adjust, AI monitoring

**STL Repair:**
- MeshInspector, Meshmixer, Formlabs auto-repair

### Round 3 - Freestyle Finds

**The ComfyUI 3D Pipeline (viral workflow, 50K views):**
1. Tripo → initial highpoly from 2 reference images
2. Hunyuan 3D Studio → lowpoly + auto UV unwrap
3. Trellis2 in ComfyUI → texturing + upscaling

**Key Repos:**
- `kijai/ComfyUI-Hunyuan3DWrapper` - run Hunyuan3D-2 in ComfyUI locally
- Hunyuan3D-2.1 now available - better textures, runs on medium GPUs

**Failure Analysis:**
- QV3D / QuinlyVision by @3dque - video → photogrammetry → 3D render of failed print
- AI identifies: under-extrusion, layer shift, spaghetti, overhangs

**Cloud Option:**
- RunComfy (runcomfy.com) - cloud ComfyUI with pre-built 3D workflows

**All-Local ComfyUI Stack:**
- Image gen + Video gen + Audio gen + 3D model gen
- People using this for 3D printing minis workflows

### Convergence Analysis (10:05 AM)

**Winn's Interest Intersections - Next-Level Plays:**

1. **Physical Agent** - MCP servers for hardware (OctoPrint, smart home, displays). Nobody building this yet.

2. **Options → Physical** - E-ink dashboards, LED strips for market regime, haptic alerts. Ambient market awareness.

3. **AI Print-on-Demand** - Text → AI generates → Print → Ship. Etsy-killer for custom 3D goods.

4. **Durango GTA** - Real GIS + AI textures + 3D printing = physical city collectibles.

5. **Grant Nexus + Maker Labs** - STEM/equipment grants for university maker spaces. Vertical expansion.

6. **The Everything Agent** - Multi-modal Clawdbot: text, voice, code, finance, physical, memory. Sovereign AI.

**Recommended first step:** Build OctoPrint MCP server. Smallest step that proves the biggest vision.

## Health & Supplements Consultation (9:27 AM MT)

### Winn's Profile (for reference)
- **Age:** 36
- **Weight:** 155 lbs
- **Height:** 5'9"
- **Health status:** Healthy male

### Foot Conditions (CHRONIC - 15 YEARS)
1. **Left foot:** Callus under pinky toe = **Tailor's bunion (bunionette)**
2. **Big toe:** Pushing under 2nd toe = **Hallux valgus with crossover toe progression**
3. **Status:** Week 3 of treatment, wants aggressive approach

**Research outcome:** After 15 years, conservative treatment will MANAGE but probably not CORRECT. Surgical consult recommended, especially for crossover toe (typically needs plantar plate repair once established).

### Supplement Stack Validated (Gemini's Assessment)
**Morning (keep):**
- Omega-3 Fish Oil, CoQ10 300mg, Vitamin K2, L-Carnitine, Cod Liver Oil, Zinc

**Evening (simplified):**
- Magnesium Glycinate 200-400mg (BEST form for sleep)
- L-Theanine 200mg
- Low-dose melatonin 0.3-1mg (NOT the 3-10mg in most products)

**Removed/Modified:**
- Rest-ZZZ: TOO MANY GABAergic compounds stacked (melatonin + GABA + valerian)
- Muscle Relax: Gym days only, check for kava (hepatotoxicity risk)

**Gaps to Add:**
- D3 5000 IU (Durango winter = low UV)
- Creatine 3-5g daily (longevity, muscle, brain)

**Critical Timing Fix:**
- Zinc and Calcium: Separate by 2+ hours (compete for absorption)

### Foot Supplements Added
- Collagen peptides 10-15g
- Vitamin C 500-1000mg
- MSM 1-3g
- Glucosamine/Chondroitin (optional)

### Action Items
- [ ] Winn to get D3 levels tested ($40 Quest)

### Quote of the Day
*"Sky is not the limit, we can go further."* — Winn

**Dub & Donny Enterprises is LIVE.** 🦾

## 11:45 AM - App Automation Breakthrough 🎮

### What We Built
- **App Automation Skill** at `skills/app-automation/SKILL.md`
- Installed MCP servers: `@peakmojo/applescript-mcp` + `@steipete/macos-automator-mcp`
- Full Godot window control via AppleScript/System Events

### Key Learnings (Micro → Meta)

**What Works:**
1. **Keystrokes > Menu clicks** - Keystrokes are fast and reliable
2. **System Events for window control** - Position/size works on ANY app
3. **Activate app first** - Always bring to front before keystrokes
4. **Small delays matter** - `delay 0.3` between actions prevents race conditions

**What Doesn't Work Well:**
1. **Menu clicking on non-native apps** - Hangs on Godot, Electron, etc.
2. **Deep UI traversal** - Enumerating all elements is painfully slow
3. **Direct app scripting varies** - Some apps expose more than others

**The Meta-Skill:**
This isn't about Godot. It's about the **pipeline**:
1. Research (Reddit, X, GitHub) → find tools people use
2. Install (MCP servers, permissions)
3. Test (simple commands first, then complex)
4. Document (what works, what fails)
5. Iterate (improve based on failures)
6. Apply to next app

### Resources Found
- **MCP Registry**: 200+ servers at registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
- **n8n-mcp**: 543 automation nodes, bridges to workflow automation
- **MobAI**: Mobile device control for iOS/Android
- **Key insight from X**: "Claude Code becoming an agentic shell - async subagents + MCP + desktop integration = developer superpowers"

### Next Steps
1. Test more apps (VS Code, Safari, Terminal)
2. Build app-specific shortcut references
3. Explore n8n-mcp for workflow chaining
4. Consider MobAI for mobile testing
