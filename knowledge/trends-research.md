## 📈 Search Trends & Signals

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) - RISING FAST
MCP is having its moment:

- **MCP Apps** just announced (Jan 26) - bringing UI capabilities to MCP clients
- Block (Square), VS Code, Zed, Sourcegraph all backing the standard
- **Remote MCP servers now outnumber local installations**
- OpenAI, Google DeepMind adopting the protocol
- Red Hat published enterprise integration guide
- Wikipedia article recently updated (high signal)

**Top MCP Servers 2026:** K2view leading with enterprise data access, Playwright for browser automation, Notion for knowledge, GitHub for code.

### AI Coding Tools Landscape
From industry coverage:
- Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot all competing for developer mindshare
- "Vibecoding" term fully mainstream (originated ~2024, now common vocabulary)
- Agent autonomy increasing but trust issues emerging

### Agentic AI - 2026 Declared "Year of Agentic AI"
- Retail/CPG focusing on AI-driven consumer behavior
- 10-15% of complex Google searches may default to AI mode by EOY
- "AI enablement specialists" emerging as new role
- Context engineering becoming a discipline

## 🎯 Emerging Patterns

### What's Rising
1. **Vibecoding acceptance** - From joke to legitimate methodology
2. **MCP adoption** - Protocol winning the AI integration wars
3. **Browser automation** - Major focus (One Browser, Playwright MCP, LemonSlice)
4. **European sovereignty** - Growing concern driving new tools
5. **Benchmark culture** - TetrisBench, SnapBench, specific capability testing

### What's Plateauing
1. **Generic "AI wrapper" products** - Market saturated
2. **Chat-only interfaces** - Voice/video agents taking over
3. **Unstructured prompting** - Moving to protocol-based interaction

### What's Declining (Skepticism Growing)
1. **AI infrastructure claims** - Cloudflare Matrix debacle shows scrutiny increasing
2. **Unfettered AI crawling** - More sites blocking Claude, AI bots
3. **Model-as-moat thinking** - Protocol/tooling differentiation winning

## 📝 Actionable Insights

1. **Build MCP servers** - The ecosystem is exploding, first-mover advantage available
2. **Browser automation is hot** - Multiple high-point projects in this space
3. **Benchmark your specific use case** - Generic benchmarks less trusted, niche benchmarks (Tetris, drone) getting attention
4. **European market** - Sovereignty tools have audience, audit tools succeeding
5. **Vibecoding is real** - Embrace it, document it, build tooling for it
