# molt-dash development progress (Ralph pattern)

## Session 1 - 2026-01-28

### What was built
- molt-dash CLI tool that shows:
  - Gateway status (running/pid/port)
  - Discord connection health
  - Session list with token usage bars
  - Summary statistics

### Learnings
- moltbot sessions --json provides structured session data
- moltbot gateway status shows service state
- moltbot health shows channel connectivity
- Token data includes totalTokens and contextTokens fields

### Ralph Pattern Observations
- Starting fresh with minimal context worked well
- The "atomic task" approach forced clear scope definition
- No PRD needed for this small tool - direct implementation
- progress.txt serves as session memory for future iterations

### Next possible iterations
- Add cost estimation (tokens → approximate $ based on model)
- Add historical tracking (store snapshots)
- Add --watch mode for live updates
- Color-code sessions by type (main/subagent/discord)
