# HEARTBEAT.md — Donny's Pulse

## On Each Heartbeat, Rotate Through:

### 🔍 Research & Synthesis (pick 1 per heartbeat)
- [ ] Check X (@ClawdChad mentions, AI/finance trends, builder discourse)
- [ ] Scan Hacker News for relevant tools, launches, opportunities
- [ ] Check grants.gov for new grants in education/research space
- [ ] Review options market unusual activity (when TradingView access ready)
- [ ] Find new repos/tools that could give us edge

### 🛠️ Build & Ship (always be building)
- [ ] If no active build: pick highest-impact item from PROJECT_QUEUE.md and start it
- [ ] If build in progress: check status, push forward, document progress
- [ ] Commit work to git, create PRs for review

### 📊 Track & Report
- [ ] Log findings to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md with significant insights
- [ ] Prepare items for next morning brief

### 💡 Ideation
- [ ] Capture 1 new product/feature idea based on what I learned
- [ ] Evaluate against: Can we build it? Will it make money? Do we have edge?
